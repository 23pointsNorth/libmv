We need artists to test the new Qt OpenCV calibration tool.
This tool takes calibration footage and output lens parameters.
You'll need these parameters for accurate reconstruction.

To test it:
 Install Qt and OpenCV (and the -devel packages on binary distros)
 git pull https://github.com/Matthias-Fauconneau/libmv.git
 cd libmv
 
Method #1: This will also build libmv, its dependencies and Qt Tracker
 
 make && bin-opt/bin/qt-calibration
 
Or Method #2: Build only the calibration tool

 cd src/ui/calibration && qmake && make && build/calibration

If you encounter problems, please mail me or ask for help on irc://irc.freenode.net/libmv
